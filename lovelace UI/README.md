## Overview
Modifications for the Lovelace UI
> January 2024: these are mostly unused at this point as I've adjusted my dashboards.

+ `room_card.yaml`: sample yaml for a heavily modified `grid` card using `mushroom-template-card`, `entities` card, and `mushroom-light-card`
+ `theme_scroll_lock.yaml`: sample custom theme for disabling scrolling and hiding the header on a dashboard
+ `theme_disable_restart.yaml`: sample custom theme for disabling a manual restart
+ `hourly-weather-card-css.yaml`: [card_mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) style for the [lovelace-hourly-weather](https://github.com/decompil3d/lovelace-hourly-weather) card to add icon+text in bar and day in info axes.
