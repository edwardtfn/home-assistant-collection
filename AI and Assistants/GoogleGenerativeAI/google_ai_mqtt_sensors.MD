The MQTT payloads look like this after a little clean up in the scripts:

History lesson:
```
The Event of March the First

Oh, let's talk about March the First,
A day of history, oh so immersed.
Congress met on this special day,
To settle a matter, come what may.

They pondered and thought, their minds in a whirl,
How to resolve the Articles of Swirl.
Should our land be governed with power so grand,
Or should the states have a helping hand?

The great James Madison, wise and keen,
Proposed a plan, a Federal scene.
Each state would have its say, you see,
But together they'd make a strong decree.

They argued and debated, back and forth they went,
Until finally, an agreement was spent.
The Constitution, our guiding light,
Was born on March the First, oh so bright.
```

Music across time:
```
{
    "song_name": "One Week",
    "band_name": "Barenaked Ladies",
    "date_released": "March 01, 1998"
}
```


The MQTT sensors use these payloads like this:
