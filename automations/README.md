+ `led_light_strip.yaml`: sample automation using `zha_event` triggers from a Zigbee remote to activate LED light strip options.
+ `rtl_433_frequency_switch.yaml`: automation for switching rtl_433 frequencies with greater flexibility than `hop_interval` permits
+ `countdown_timer`: series of timer helpers, scripts, and automations that work together to create a timer to turn off a light, with a visual warning shortly before turning off
